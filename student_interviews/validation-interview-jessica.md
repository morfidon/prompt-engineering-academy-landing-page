- Thanked her for joining, asked about her marketing role
- Jessica runs marketing for a B2B SaaS company, uses AI 3-4 times per week
- Expressed moderate frustration with AI content quality
- Seemed professional but somewhat skeptical

## Screen Sharing & Navigation (15 mins)
**Initial Reaction:**

- **Minimal emotional reaction** to the pain points presented

**Key Navigation Patterns:**

- "That's interesting" (when reading about community features)
- "I'm not sure if this applies to my use case" (when reviewing pain points)
- "The workshops seem like a lot of time commitment" (membership features)

## Offer Fit Assessment
**Final CTA Reaction:**
- **Brief glance** at pricing section
- When asked if interested: **"I don't think this is for me right now"**

**Direct Response:**
- "It seems like a good program, just not for my current needs"
- "I'm not struggling enough with AI to justify the monthly cost"
- "Maybe if I was doing more content creation, but I'm not there yet"

## Concluding Questions
**What would make this a no-brainer?**
- "Probably nothing at this point"
- "I'd need to be using AI more heavily in my daily work"
- "Maybe if there was a free version or pay-per-use option"
- "Or if my company covered it as professional development"

**Additional Feedback:**
- "The page looks professional and well-designed"
- "I can see how this would be valuable for heavy content creators"
- "I'm just not the ideal customer for this"
- "The content seems comprehensive, just not relevant to me currently"

## Overall Assessment
**Category:** CLEAR NO
**Primary Reason:** Not a heavy enough AI user, doesn't feel significant pain
**Key Insight:** Product quality is good, but timing/persona fit is wrong
**No Major Objections to Product Quality:** Just not the right customer segment

## Follow-up Recommendations
- No immediate follow-up needed
- Could re-engage in 6-12 months if AI usage increases
- Keep on mailing list for future content marketing trends

## Key Insights for Landing Page
- May need to better qualify who the product is for early in the page
- Consider adding "Who this is for" section earlier
- Pain points only resonate with current heavy AI users
- Casual users may not see enough value to justify monthly cost

## Persona Mismatch Indicators
- Minimal emotional reaction to pain points
- Quick scrolling without deep engagement
- Focus on time commitment rather than benefits
- Price sensitivity due to low current usage
