# Validation Interview Notes - Emily Watson

**Interview Date:** February 15, 2026
**Duration:** 25 minutes
**Prospect Profile:** UX Designer, 31, uses AI occasionally for user research summaries and design ideation
**Recording:** Yes (transcript available)

## Call Introduction (5-10 mins)
- Thanked her for joining, asked about her design work
- Emily works at a tech startup, uses AI maybe 2-3 times per week
- Expressed mild frustration but not intense pain with AI
- Seemed polite but not particularly enthusiastic about the topic

## Screen Sharing & Navigation (12 mins)
**Initial Reaction:**
- Read hero section quickly: "Work faster with clarity, control, and confidence" - **neutral expression**
- **Skimmed** pain points section without much engagement
- **Minimal reaction** to the pain points - didn't relate strongly

**Key Navigation Patterns:**
- **Quick scrolling** through most sections
- **Paused briefly** on testimonials but didn't read carefully
- **Spent more time** on FAQ section than other content
- **Jumped around** rather than reading sequentially

**Verbal Feedback During Navigation:**
- "I see..." (non-committal response to benefits)
- "That's nice" (when reading about community features)
- "I don't really use AI that much" (when reviewing pain points)
- "The workshops seem interesting but I'm not sure I have time" (membership features)

## Offer Fit Assessment
**Final CTA Reaction:**
- **Brief glance** at pricing section
- When asked if interested: **"No, I don't think this is for me right now"**

**Direct Response:**
- "It seems like a good product, just not for my current situation"
- "I'm not a heavy enough AI user to justify paying monthly"
- "Maybe if I used AI more in my work, but right now I don't"

## Concluding Questions
**What would make this a no-brainer?**
- "Honestly, probably nothing at this point"
- "I'd need to be using AI a lot more in my daily work"
- "Maybe if there was a free version or one-time purchase"
- "Or if my company paid for it as training"

**Additional Feedback:**
- "The page looks professional and well-designed"
- "I can see how this would be valuable for heavy users"
- "I'm just not the target audience for this"
- "The content seems comprehensive, just not relevant to me now"

## Overall Assessment
**Category:** CLEAR NO
**Primary Reason:** Not a heavy AI user, doesn't feel the pain
**Key Insight:** Product solves real problems but for specific user segment
**No Major Objections to Product Quality:** Just wrong timing/persona fit

## Follow-up Recommendations
- No immediate follow-up needed
- Could re-engage in 6-12 months if AI usage increases
- Keep on mailing list for future AI integration trends

## Key Insights for Landing Page
- May need to better qualify who the product is for early in the page
- Consider adding "Who this is for" section earlier
- Pain points only resonate with current heavy AI users
- Casual users may not see enough value to justify monthly cost

## Persona Mismatch Indicators
- Minimal emotional reaction to pain points
- Quick scrolling without engagement
- Focus on time commitment rather than benefits
- Price sensitivity due to low current usage
